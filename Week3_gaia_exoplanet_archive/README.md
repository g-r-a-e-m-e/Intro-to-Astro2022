#### Agenda:
* Intro
* Writing exercise
* NASA Exoplanet Archive tutorial
* Gaia Database tutorial
* Discussion Questions for ["Planets around Proxima Centauri"](https://www.pnas.org/doi/pdf/10.1073/pnas.1706680114)

### Intro

Feel free to share some of your thoughts on [Piazza](https://piazza.com/intro_to_astro/summer2022/intro2astro2022) to continue the discussion!

### Tutorials
1. NASA Exoplanet Archive
  - What is the NASA Exoplanet Archive?
  - What kind of data does it contain?
  - How can I access the data myself?
  - How do I visualize the data?
2. Gaia Database
  - What is Gaia?
  - How can I access Gaia data? Basic and advanced queries.
  - A bit on ADQL
  - Plotting a color-magnitude diagram

### Discussion Questions
1. How does the multiplicity of stellar systems (i.e. single stars vs binaries, triples, etc.) affect the prospects for finding life on planets?
2. Do you think the distance based habitable-zone is a good indicator for possibility to hold life? If you had to distill the "ingredients" for producing intelligent life on a planet down to a short list, what would it be?

## Assignments for this Week

### I NASA Exoplanet Archive tutorial
Complete sections 3, 4, and 5 in NASA Exoplanet Archive Jupyter notebook tutorial (see instructions inside notebook).
Post your answers to section 5 on [Piazza note @30](https://piazza.com/class/l3j39nx56bkxf?cid=30)

### II Gaia Database tutorial
The tutorial questions are at the bottom of the 'GaiaTutorialAssignment.ipynb' file. Make sure you try working with ADQL and do some test queries beforehand! 
1. Download the data for the closest 10,000 stars using ADQL
2. Plot HR Diagram for a few other clusters (NGC 1893, M4, NGC 581) to see the similarities and differences in HRDs.

### III Discussion Questions
Choose 2 discussion questions (above) to respond to in your online notebook.

### IV Paper of the Week
